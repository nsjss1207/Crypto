Forbidden Paths

In this flag as the website is filtering out absolute paths, I searched to find a way through that. I came across relative paths which can use the path relative to the current directory. By using relative paths by using the .. command be can be used to access the next directory. By replacing the absolute path usr/share/nginx/html/ with ../../../../flag.txt we get the flag.
