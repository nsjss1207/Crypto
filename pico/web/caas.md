In this following CTF, I first read about how a person could attack a website. I found that injection attacks are common in webistes that accept inout from users.
Using that information I came across command injections in which linux commands can be passed with the given command on the page.

After running the ls command several files were displayed on the screen. Using the cat command with the falg.txt file I found the password.
