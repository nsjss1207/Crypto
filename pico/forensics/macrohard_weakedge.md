In programming, a macro is a fragment of code which has been given a name. This name, represented by an identifier, is replaced by the code it represents before the program is compiled. Even though it can make the code more readable it also poses security threats.

After going through the ppt and finding nothing, i searched the web aand got to know that sometimes these files can be zipped. By using the unzip command of linux i was able to get the contents of the file which also contained the hidden file.

After entering through the directories and reading the file i found a text which seems to be base64 encoded. After decoding it i found the flag.
