First installed GDB on to the machine. The file was a ELF 64bit LSB pie executable which is used to store binaries in linux. After some reading online i used the lay next command to interact with the file. We can see the value assigned to eax is 0x86342 which is in hex. Converting this to decimal we get the flag.
